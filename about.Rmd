I am a Masters student in the Genome Sciences and Technology graduate program at UBC. My work involves single-cell epigenetics applied to mammalian cancers. My Bachelors was also at UBC, but focused on Microbiology and Immunology; my aim with this masters is to transition into a data science role from a wet lab scientist role.

I am very passionate about Data Science. To that end, I founded [DataSense](http://makedatasense.ca/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github_readme&utm_campaign=passive), which aims to educate and inspire the next generation of data scientists
