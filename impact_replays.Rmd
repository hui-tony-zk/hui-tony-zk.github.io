In November 2015, I lead a team of three others to participate in IBM's [Sportshack2015](http://sportshackweekend.org/ca/2015/). Our challenge was to produce something that will help the Canadian Football league using their data.

We created a simple webapp (all within RStudio's Shiny!) to visualize play-by-play data from the CFL. You can view our final product here: https://daattali.com/shiny/cfl/

At the end, we came in third place in all of Canada, beating out 20 other teams consisting of over 60 people.
